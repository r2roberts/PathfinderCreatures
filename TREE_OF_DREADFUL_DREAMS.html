        <disable>Athletics or Thievery DC 25 (trained) to force or lever open a single branch, disabling that branch and freeing any creature trapped within. Thievery DC 29 (expert) to disrupt the tree&#8217;s magical animation, shut it down, and free all trapped creatures. Placing a dreamstone in the tree&#8217;s trunk takes 2 Interact actions and causes the trap to shut down, freeing all trapped creatures. Placing the cursed dreamstone from area B4 in the trunk instead increases the tree&#8217;s actions per turn to 4 and gives it a +2 item bonus to all saving throws and attack rolls.</disable>
