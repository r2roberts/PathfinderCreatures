# PathfinderCreatures

An HTML/CSS project for creating Pathfinder 2e creature stat blocks using an XML-like format

This project was inspired by the work of Apostol Apostolov in his GM Binder project.
See his work by joining Grit and Glory Discord at https://discord.gg/ZDtCmhm

The action icons were "borrowed" from the Archives of Nethys, http://2e.aonprd.com/
