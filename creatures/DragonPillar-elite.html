          A dragon pillar can see through its empty eye sockets, and it can
          recognize Cinderclaws and their allies. A character disguised as a
          Cinderclaw can trick a dragon pillar into perceiving it as a
          Cinderclaw ally by using Deception to Impersonate. A dragon pillar
          always uses Perception for initiative.

          A 10-foot-tall wooden pole topped by a wooden carving of Dahak’s head.
          Each dragon pillar’s head has been treated with something to give it a
          distinct color, as indicated in the specific encounter, but regardless
          of color, plumes of smoke waft up from the mouth.
